# Formalization of Phase Ordering

## Abstract

Phasers pose an interesting synchronization mechanism that generalizes many collective
synchronization patterns seen in parallel programming languages, including barriers, clocks, and
point-to-point synchronization using latches or semaphores. This work characterizes scheduling constraints
on phaser operations, by relating the execution state of two tasks that operate on the same phaser.
We propose a formalization of Habanero phasers, May-Happen-In-Parallel, and Happens-Before
relations for phaser operations, and show that these relations conform with the semantics. Our
formalization and proofs are fully mechanized using the Coq proof assistant, and are available online.
