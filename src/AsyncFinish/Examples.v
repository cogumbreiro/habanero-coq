  The FX10 language is not concerned with observing the behaviour of tasks,
  it is instead focused with observing the interaction among procedures.

  (t1: "finish { async S3 f() } S2") -> (t1, begin_finish)
  (t1: "async S3 f()"> |> t1: "S2"

  We represent finish scope by a mapping from task identifiers of type [tid] to
  tasks of type [task]. A task [t] is either ready [!t] to execute or blocked
  on finish scope [f], notation
  [t <| f].
  
  Operator [put f (t, a)], notation [|+] updates the finish scope [f], by
  setting task [t] to have a task body [a].
  
  For example, let task [t1] be ready in a finish scope. If task [t1]
  issues a [BEGIN_FINISH], then we put task [t1] blocked on a new finish
  state where [t1] itself is running. In HJ, the same can begin multiple
  finish scopes.
