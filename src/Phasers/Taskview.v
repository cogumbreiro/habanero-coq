Section Defs.
  (**
    The taskview represents the local view of a phaser that a registered
    task has. It records: the number of signals
    the task issued, the number of waits the task issued, and the task's
    registration mode. The taskview is changed by invoking signal and wait
    on a phaser (or next). 
  *)

  Record taskview := mk_taskview {
    signal_phase: nat;
    wait_phase: nat;
    mode: regmode
  }.

  (** * Creation *)

  (**
    When creating a phaser, the creator is the only task registered in that phaser.
    Value [make] represents the first taskview that is initialized in [SIGNAL_WAIT] mode
    and accounts for zero signals and zero waits.
  *)

  Definition make := mk_taskview 0 0 SIGNAL_WAIT.

  (** * Basic mutators *)

  (** We define the mutators of a taskview. These are only used internally. *)

  Definition set_signal_phase v n := mk_taskview n (wait_phase v) (mode v).
  Definition set_wait_phase v n := mk_taskview (signal_phase v) n (mode v).
  Definition set_mode v m := mk_taskview (signal_phase v) (wait_phase v) m.

  (** * Signal *)

  (** 
    The two mutators available of taskviews are signal and wait, defined following.
    The semantics of signal depends on the
    registration mode of the issuer (this is captured by [SignalPre]: 
    [SIGNAL_WAIT] tasks interleave signals and waits and the first operation is a signal;
    [SIGNAL_ONLY] tasks can always issue a signal.
  *)

  Inductive SignalPre v: Prop :=
    | signal_pre_w:
      mode v = SIGNAL_WAIT ->
      wait_phase v = signal_phase v ->
      SignalPre v
    | signal_pre_s:
      mode v = SIGNAL_ONLY ->
      SignalPre v.

  (** The operation simply increments the signal phase. *)

  Definition signal v := set_signal_phase v (S (signal_phase v)).

  (**
    At the language-level, however, invoking [signal] multiple times is not considered
    an error, yet only the first [signal] after a [wait] is observed. Precondition [SignalPre v]
    models the first [signal] after a wait.
    Function [try_signal] can be invoked without a pre-condition and models the user-facing
    signal operation.
  *)

  Definition try_signal v :=
  match mode v with
  | SIGNAL_WAIT => set_signal_phase v (S (wait_phase v))
  | _ => signal v
  end.

  (** * Wait *)

  (**
    The wait operation increments the wait-phase.
    A [SIGNAL_WAIT] task must have signalled before invoking wait.
    Tasks registered as [WAIT_ONLY] are always capable of invoking a wait.
    [SIGNAL_ONLY] tasks cannot issue a wait.
  *)

  Inductive WaitPre v: Prop :=
    | wait_pre_wo:
      mode v = WAIT_ONLY ->
      WaitPre v
    | wait_pre_sw:
      mode v = SIGNAL_WAIT ->
      S (wait_phase v) = signal_phase v ->
      WaitPre v.

  Definition wait v := set_wait_phase v (S (wait_phase v)).


  (** * Small-step operational semantics*)

  (**
    The operational semantics not only defines a closed set of operations that
    can operate on a value (here a taskview), but also defines the preconditions of
    each operation.
    Contrary to [eval], relation [Reduces] defines a precondition
    to [wait], called [WaitPre]: in order to issue a wait, the wait phase must be
    behind (smaller than) the signal phase. We define [CanWait] so it can be reused
    in other developments.

    The operational semantics of taskviews defines a closed set of operations [op]
    that can change taskviews, signal and  wait.
  *)

  Inductive op := SIGNAL | WAIT.

  (**
  Function [eval] interprets the given operation [o] as the appropriate function.
  *)

  Definition eval o :=
  match o with
  | SIGNAL => signal
  | WAIT => wait
  end.

  Inductive Reduces v : op -> taskview -> Prop :=
    | tv_reduces_signal:
      SignalPre v ->
      Reduces v SIGNAL (signal v)
    | tv_reduces_wait:
      WaitPre v ->
      Reduces v WAIT (wait v).
