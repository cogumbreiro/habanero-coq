(**
  The taskview represents the local view of a phaser that a registered
  task has. It records: the number of signals
  the task issued, the number of waits the task issued, and the task's
  registration mode. The taskview is changed by invoking signal and wait
  on a phaser (or next). 
*)

Record taskview := TV {
  signal_phase: nat;
  wait_phase: nat;
  mode: regmode
}.

(**
  When creating a phaser, the creator is the only task registered in that phaser.
  Value [make] represents the first taskview that is initialized in [SIGNAL_WAIT] mode
  and accounts for zero signals and zero waits.
 *)

Definition make := TV 0 0 SIGNAL_WAIT.

(** We define the mutators of a taskview. These are only used internally. *)

Definition set_signal_phase v n := TV n (wait_phase v) (mode v).
Definition set_wait_phase v n := TV (signal_phase v) n (mode v).
Definition set_mode v m := TV (signal_phase v) (wait_phase v) m.

      wait_phase v = signal_phase v ->

    | signal_pre_s:
      mode v = SIGNAL_ONLY ->
      SignalPre v.
(** 
  The two mutators available of taskviews are signal and wait, defined following.
  The semantics of signal depends on the
  registration mode of the issuer: when the issuer is registered in signal-only mode,
  a signal increments the signal phase; otherwise, the signal becomes sets the signal-phase
  one phase ahead of the wait phase (this is to "absord" consecutive signals before a wait).
*)

Definition signal v := set_signal_phase v (S (signal_phase v)).

(**
  Function [safe_signal] can be invoked even when [Taskview.SignalPre] is not respected,
  the semantics is more intricate as it must consider the case when a signal-wait
  task performs multiple signals.
 *)

Definition try_signal v :=
  match mode v with
  | SIGNAL_WAIT => set_signal_phase v (S (wait_phase v))
  | _ => signal v
  end.

(**
  A task with wait capability must interleave a signal with an await.
  Only the first signal is observed by other tasks, and consecutive signals are ignored until
  another the task invokes a waits, which is why the signal phase in relation to the wait phase.
  We postpone discussing the error-conditions of invoking signal and wait to
  the presentation of the operational semantics of task view operations.

  The wait operation increments the wait-phase. Altough the semantics of wait does not depends
  on the registration mode, invoking wait should be guarded by a precondition that we postpone
  its definition to the following section.
*)

  (**
  The operational semantics not only defines a closed set of operations that
  can operate on a value (here a taskview), but also defines the preconditions of
  each operation.
  Contrary to [eval], relation [Reduces] defines a precondition
  to [wait], called [WaitPre]: in order to issue a wait, the wait phase must be
  behind (smaller than) the signal phase. We define [CanWait] so it can be reused
  in other developments.
